# Hello World LAB

The purpose of this lab assignment is to make this readme file, and talk on what the application behind the README.md file does. HelloWorldLab is a code that lets you write your name or whatever word you would like in the Edit Text, and whatever text is filled will then be added towards, or beside the display text. The click me button is there to confirm the change made on the exit text.
